# ArkForge Trust Layer — MCP Server

Third-party cryptographic proof for AI agent API calls.

Works with **Claude, GPT-4, Mistral, LangChain, AutoGen**, or any HTTP client.
The proof is signed by ArkForge (independent third party) — **not by your agent**.

---

## Why this matters

When an AI agent calls an external API, there is no independent record of what was sent, what was received, or when it happened. The agent could lie. The API could lie. There is no verifiable audit trail.

ArkForge fixes this by acting as a **certifying proxy**: the agent routes its API call through ArkForge, which signs the full request+response bundle with an Ed25519 key, timestamps it via RFC 3161, and anchors it in [Sigstore Rekor](https://rekor.sigstore.dev) — an immutable, publicly auditable log.

The resulting proof is permanently verifiable at a public URL, by anyone, without contacting ArkForge.

**This is the difference between a self-signed certificate and a CA-issued one.** Tools like PiQrypt or Attestix produce proofs signed by the agent itself. ArkForge produces proofs signed by an independent third party.

## Tools

### `certify_call`
Call an external API and get a cryptographic proof of the transaction.

```
target          URL of the upstream API to call
payload         JSON body (optional)
method          "POST" or "GET" (default: "POST")
description     Human-readable description included in the proof
agent_identity  Identifier for the calling agent (optional)
```

Returns `proof_id`, `verification_url`, `upstream_response`, `chain_hash`, `timestamp`, and Ed25519 `signature`.

**Use this instead of calling the API directly** when you need an auditable record.

### `get_proof`
Retrieve the full proof bundle for a given `proof_id`.

### `verify_proof`
Get a human-readable summary of what a proof certifies — useful for explaining to a user or auditor what was independently verified.

### `get_usage`
Check your remaining credits for the current month.

## What each proof contains

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `proof_id` | Unique identifier — permanent public URL |
| `hashes.request` | SHA-256 of the exact request sent |
| `hashes.response` | SHA-256 of the exact response received |
| `hashes.chain` | Combined hash — tamper-evident |
| `parties.seller` | Domain of the called API |
| `timestamp_authority` | RFC 3161 timestamp via FreeTSA (QTSP eIDAS on Enterprise) |
| `rekor` | Sigstore Rekor immutable log entry |
| `arkforge_signature` | Ed25519 signature by ArkForge's independent key |

## Works with any agent framework

The MCP server is one integration path. The same REST API works from any language or framework:

```bash
curl -X POST https://arkforge.tech/trust/v1/proxy \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "https://api.example.com/action", "payload": {"data": "value"}}'
```
